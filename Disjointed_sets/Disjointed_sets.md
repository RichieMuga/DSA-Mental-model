# Disjointed sets
- This is a datastructure that is used to determine whether elements belong to a set or different sets

- NB: it is mainly used in kruskal's algorithim to detect cycles, get invalid edges in a graph

# Operations in disjoined sets.
- They mainly include:
                        - *Find* : whereby we find the node on a given graph
                        - *Union* : whereby we unionize/join/connect vertices with an edge

# Representational formats of a disjoined set.
- Graphical representation
- Array representation.

## Important things to note:
- In Kruskal's algorithim, it is important to understand and implement rank for each given element and compression for faster lookups

## time and space complexity
- It is usually o(e+v)
