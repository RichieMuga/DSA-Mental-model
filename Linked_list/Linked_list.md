## Linked list
- It is a datastrucuture that uses refrences/pointers to allow data to be accessed.

There are two types of linked lists, namely:
    - Singly Linked Lists
    - Doubly Linked LIsts

#### Singly Linked Lists

- It contains node(s) which contains namely two elements, a value and a next pointer/reference.
- The first node is called the head and the last node is called the tail.

#### Importance of linked lists
- Easier traversal as compared to other data structures such as arrays
- Easier inserts as compared to arrays
- Easier deletions compared to arrays
- Because of pointers, it has order since, a node points to the next node hence better compared to hashtables
