# Arrays
- This is a datastructure that is used to **squentialy** organize data

## Types of arrays
- [x] Dynamic arrays: - One does not determine the size ahead of implementing it(common in languages like js and python)
- [x] Static arrays: One determines the size before implementing it(common in languages like java)


## Common methods in arrarys used in DSA(python)
- append: add at the end of the array. (O(1))
- pop: remove at the end of the array. (O(1))
- sort: arrange the array from ascending to descending((O(n log b))). This is really bad
