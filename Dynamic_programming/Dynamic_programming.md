# Dynamic_programming
- This is a problem solving technique that breaks down complex problems into smaller, overlapping sub problems, solves them, and stores the solution to avoid redundant calculations, leading to more efficient algorithims.

## Steps involved
- The following are the the steps involved in solving dp problems:
    1. Solve the question naively
    2. Top down dp memoization(recursive soltion)
    3. Bottom down dp(tabulation solution)
    4. Bottom up with constant space

- The best question to practise dp problems as a begginer is:
