# DSA-Mental-model

![Data Structures and Algorithms](/pictures/dsa-banner.png)

A comprehensive collection of notes, implementations, and mental models for mastering Data Structures and Algorithms.

## Motivation

My desire to learn is from a strong desire to build a solid foundation in computer science fundamentals. This repository serves as both my personal learning journey and a resource for others facing similar challenges.

I believe that having clear mental models for DSA concepts is crucial for:
- Solving complex programming problems efficiently
- Performing well in technical interviews
- Writing optimized, scalable code
- Understanding how modern software systems work under the hood

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by data structures and algorithm patterns:

- **Arrays**: Most common type of datastructure widely used and extreemly important
- **Hashmaps**: Among the most common type of datastructure,that stores values in key value pairs hence reducing lookup and insert to O(1)
- **Stacks**: Commonly used in backtracking and dfs questions
- **BFS_DFS**: Breadth-First Search and Depth-First Search algorithms
- **Disjointed_sets**: Implementation and usage of union-find data structure
- **Dynamic_programming**: Solutions to optimization problems using memoization and tabulation
- **Graphs**: Graph representations and algorithms
- **Heaps**: Priority queue implementations using heap data structure
- **Linked_list**: Singly and doubly linked list implementations
- **Sliding_window**: Technique for solving array/string problems with contiguous elements
- **Tries**: Prefix tree data structure for efficient string operations

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RichieMuga/DSA-Mental-model.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the specific topic you're interested in learning

3. Each directory contains:
   - Implementation code (primarily in Python)
   - Explanation notes
   - Diagrams and visualizations
   - Problem examples and solutions

## Learning Approach

The materials in this repository are organized to facilitate:

1. **Conceptual Understanding**: Clear explanations of how each data structure or algorithm works
2. **Visual Learning**: Diagrams and illustrations to aid in building mental models
3. **Practical Implementation**: Code examples that you can run and modify
4. **Problem Solving**: Application of concepts to solve algorithmic challenges

## Recent Updates
